#  SpinnySideUp an ASP .Net Application built using C# and Entity Framework. 

###  This Application was built specifically for the use by AH-64 Helicopter (Apache) pilots.  
The purpose was to replace their flight log book. This automates the process of keeping track of flights, hours, missions and minimums. 
The application has full CRUD for both pilots and the flights.

###  Next: Pilots who created the flights can only see their flights and preform operations on them. Only administrators can Delete a pilot. Implement minimum tracking.

###  Future direction: Brach out to other airframes.
