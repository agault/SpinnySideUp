#  SpinnySideUp an ASP .Net Application built using C#, SQL and Entity Framework. 

###  This Application was built specifically for the use by AH-64 Helicopter (Apache) pilots.  
The purpose was to replace their flight log book. This automates the process of keeping track of flights, hours, missions and minimums. 
The application has full CRUD for both pilots and the flights.

###  Difficulties:
The predominent difficulty for me in this project was this was the first time I've used Entity Framework. The code first mentality was hard initially as remembering to run migrations was not always something I did.

###  Successes:
As this was my first time using Entity Framework I knew going in i would stumble. However I grew so much from it. My Debugging skills have definitly grown. I have a greater understanding of the MVC relations and structures. I actually want to keep working on this project.

###  Next: 
Pilots who created the flights can only see their flights and preform operations on them. Only administrators can Delete a pilot. Implement minimum tracking.

###  Future direction: 
Brach out to other airframes.
